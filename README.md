## R Shiny Application for CCDPH Infectious Disease Health Equity Data

Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) serves a diverse population of over 2 million individuals in 125 municipalities with wide disparities in terms of health outcomes and social determinants of health. In the past, publicly-accessible data from the Communicable Disease Unit at CCDPH were available only as static tables or PDF surveillance reports. One area of focus in CCDPH’s 2018 strategic plan is to make accessing heath data more flexible and user-friendly.This application includes interactive scatter and box plots that allow users to compare selected infectious disease rates with pre-loaded social indicators. Users can also map data by Suburban Cook County municipality. If a user is interested in a specific municipality, they can easily select one, which is then highlighted in each graph and map. Furthermore, a municipality profile dashboard is generated, displaying the municipality’s size, location, income, racial/ethnic makeup, and infectious disease rates relative to the rest of Suburban Cook County. This allows members of the public to better visualize health equity trends and disparities in their local communities. 

Once the application is live, a link will be posted here.

Data is not included in the repository; however, visitors are welcome to view and borrow code.
